# Lecture notes and solved exercises
You have reached the collection of typeset notes I have compiled while studying in the physics program at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/) (FMF) at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. The notes are probably of interest primarily to FMF students taking the same courses. For orientation, you might also be interested in the course of study in [English](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/study-physics/programmes/1Fiz/2020/7000777/) or in [Slovene](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/sl/studij-fizike/programi/1Fiz/2020/7000777/).

## Year 1
Nothing to show here. I had not yet learned LaTeX and only took handwritten notes.
