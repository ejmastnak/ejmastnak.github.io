## About
This project was born with professor Primož Ziherl's goal of making the physics program at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Mathematics and Physics more approachable to non-Slovene speakers. Having moved to Slovenia from the United States myself (admittedly with decent existing knowledge of Slovene) and experiencing some difficulty in acclimating to an unfamiliar language firsthand, I was happy to join the project.

The textbook is based on lectures from the first-year undergraduate course *Klasična fizika* (Classical physics), taught for many years by professor Marko Mikuž; the lectures were conveniently recorded on video during coronavirus-induced lock-down in the 2020-2021 academic year. The course covers the standard general physics curriculum, including
- Newtonian mechanics of a single particle and systems of particles
- Deformations and elasticity
- Oscillations and period motion
- Newtonian gravitation
- Introductory fluid mechanics
- Mechanical waves
- Classical thermodynamics
- Classical electromagnetism
- Electromagnetic wave propagation and antennas 
- Geometrical optics
