## About
This project began with the goal of making the physics program at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Mathematics and Physics more approachable to non-Slovene speakers, and currently aims to provide an English-language textbook to accompany the first-year general physics course *Klasična fizika* (Classical physics).

The textbook's material is based on professor Marko Mikuž's lectures of *Klasična fizika* from the 2020-2021 academic year, which were conveniently recorded on video during the coronavirus-induced lockdown in Slovenia at that time.
The course covers the standard undergraduate general physics curriculum, including

- Newtonian mechanics of a single particle and systems of particles
- Deformations and elasticity
- Oscillations and periodic motion
- Newtonian gravitation
- Introductory fluid mechanics
- Mechanical waves
- Classical thermodynamics
- Classical electromagnetism
- Electromagnetic wave propagation and antennas 
- Geometrical optics
