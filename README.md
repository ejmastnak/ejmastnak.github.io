# ejmastnak.github.io

### :warning: My website now lives at [github.com/ejmastnak/ejmastnak.com](https://github.com/ejmastnak/ejmastnak.com)

This repository is now archived and will no longer be updated.

What happened: around December 2022 I switched from...

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for static site generation 
1. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting
1. `ejmastnak.github.io` to `ejmastnak.com` for a domain name.

...and created a new GitHub repo for the Hugo version of my website.

Why?

1. Hugo has orders of magnitude faster build time and fewer dependency headaches than Jekyll.
1. Netlify made it easier then GitHub pages to set up SSL certificates for both `ejmastnak.com` and the `www.ejmastnak.com` subdomain, and generally "just works".
1. I own the domain `ejmastnak.com`, while GitHub owns `ejmastnak.github.io`.
  Having my own domain gives me more flexibility with where I host, allows emails to `@ejmastnak.com`, and also looks more professional.
