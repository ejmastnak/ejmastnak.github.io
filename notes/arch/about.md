# Find Your Footing After Installing Arch Linux

Bite-sized tutorials to help you set up a functional work environment after a minimal install of Arch Linux
(read: things requiring manual setup on Arch that I had previously taken for granted coming from macOS).
The material should be applicable, with adjustments to package installation, to most `systemd`-based Linux distros.

## Useful basics
