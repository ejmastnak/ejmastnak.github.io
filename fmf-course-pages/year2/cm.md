## Course description
*Klasična mehanika* is a required course for second-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the summer semester of the 2019-20 academic year, when the course was taught by professor Anton Ramšak (lecture); and dr. Jernej Mravlje and mag. fiz. Lara Ulčakar. The course covers Lagrangian mechanics at an upper-undergraduate level; specific material includes
- review of Newtonian dynamics: orthogonal curvilinear coordinates; non-inertial coordinate systems
- the Lagrange equations and the principle of least action
- the Lagrange equations and D'Alembert's principle
- Noether's theorem
- small oscillations
- the central force problem
- the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies
- introduction to Hamiltonian mechanics: Hamilton's equations, Poisson brackets
