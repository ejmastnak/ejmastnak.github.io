## Course description
*Elektromagnetno polje* is a required course for third-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the winter semester of the 2020-21 academic year, when the course was taught by professor Miha Ravnik (lecture) and asst. professor Martin Klanj≈°ek (exercises). Material covered in the course includes:
- electrostatics
- magnetostatics
- Maxwell's equations in free space and in matter
- frequency-dependent models of the dielectric constant
- an introduction to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of electrodynamics
- an introduction relativistic electrodynamics
