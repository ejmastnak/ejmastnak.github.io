## Course description
*Numerične metode* is an elective course offered to second-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the summer semester of the 2019-20 academic year, when the course was taught by professor Emil Žagar. The course covers numerical methods at an introductory level; specific material includes
- systems of linear equations
- iterative methods for non-linear equations
- linear least squares
- eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- polynomial interpolation
- integration and methods for ordinary differential equations
