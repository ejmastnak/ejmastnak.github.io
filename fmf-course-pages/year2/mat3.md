## Course description
*Matematika 3* is a required course for second-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the winter semester of the 2019-20 academic year, when the course was taught by asst. professor Oliver Dragičević (lecture); and asst. professor Martin Raič and dr. Blaž Jelenc (exercises). Material covered in the course includes:
- parameter-dependent integrals; the gamma and beta functions
- multiple Riemann integration
- curves and surfaces in three-dimensional real space
- vector analysis
- ordinary differential equations
- an introduction to Hilbert spaces and Fourier series
