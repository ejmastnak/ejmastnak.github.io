## License

This website is dual-licensed.
I have made this choice because the website contains a mixture of software, multimedia, and original writing, and there is not (or, at least, I do not know of) a single open-source/open-access license well-suited to covering all of this content at once.
Thus, where not explicitly stated otherwise:

- Original code (for example, HTML, CSS, and shell script files) is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

- Original writing, images, and animations (for example, PDF, Markdown, image, and video files) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
