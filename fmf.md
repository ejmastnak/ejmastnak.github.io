# Lecture notes and solved exercises

**PDFs are two clicks away**---first pick a course (e.g. Electromagnetism) in the list below, then pick a document (e.g. Solved exercises).

- What you're reading: the collection of typeset notes I compiled while studying in the physics program at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/) (FMF) at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia.
  The notes come mostly from the final three semesters.
  [(Link to the curriculum)]({% link fmf-pdfs/meta/fmf-courses.pdf %}).

- Intended audience: primarily FMF students taking the same courses, but everyone is welcome!

- Wait you wrote 1500 pages of LaTeX lecture notes in three semesters?
  Yeah I guess it turned out that way, here's a guide to how I did it: [**Real-time LaTeX with (Neo)Vim**]({% link tutorials/vim-latex/intro.md %}).

  1500 pages of notes is nothing too special by the way---check out [Dexter Chua's Cambridge notes](https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/) for something *really* cool.

  ...in te zanima karkoli v zvezi z računalniškimi orodij/workflowi za izdelavo teh zapiskov in spletne strani (hitro TeXiranje, Linux, Vim, shell scripting, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, ipd.)?
  Če ti ni nerodno mi sam en <a href="contact.html">mail napiši</a> in ti z veseljem pomagam/kaj pokažem.
