# Find Your Footing After Installing Arch Linux

**What you're reading:** Bite-sized tutorials to help you set up a functional work environment after a minimal install of Arch Linux
(read: solutions to all my stumbling points when migrating to Arch from macOS).
The material should be applicable, with adjustments to package installation, to most `systemd`-based Linux distros.

**Purpose:** lower the barrier to entry and improve the transition experience for new users.
