# Lecture notes and solved exercises
You have reached the collection of typeset notes I have compiled while studying in the physics program at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/) (FMF) at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia.
The notes are probably of interest primarily to FMF students taking the same courses.

For orientation, here is a [condensed summary of the FMF undergraduate curriculum]({% link fmf-pdfs/meta/fmf-courses.pdf %}).

## Year 3
- [Electromagnetism]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/emp.md %})
- [Quantum mechanics]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/qm.md %})
- [Continuum mechanics]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/contmech.md %})
- [Measurement of ionizing radiation]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/meris.md %})
- [Optics]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/optics.md %})
- [Physical measurements]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/fizmer.md %})
- [Solid state physics]({% link fmf-course-pages/year3/ss.md %})

Missing: Laboratory 5, Data acquisition and processing, Mathematical physics practicum

## Year 2
- [Classical mechanics]({% link fmf-course-pages/year2/cm.md %})
- [Numerical methods]({% link fmf-course-pages/year2/nummet.md %})
- [Mathematics 3]({% link fmf-course-pages/year2/mat3.md %})
- [Mathematics 4]({% link fmf-course-pages/year2/mat4.md %})
- [Statistical thermodynamics]({% link fmf-course-pages/year2/std.md %})

Missing: Laboratory 3, Laboratory 4, Modern physics 1, Modern physics 2, Electronics 1, Electronics 2, Probability in physics, Mathematical physics.

## Year 1
Nothing to show here. I had not yet learned LaTeX and only took handwritten notes.
